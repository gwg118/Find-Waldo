# Find Waldo
This web application is developed to track patients through a facility. The app is built with ASP.Net in an MVC framework environment with a backend SQL database.The front end of the app is a combination of HTML, CSS, Java Scripting, VB, JQuiry, and BootStrap. It is C# and Object Oriented Programming based.    

# Overview

Since facilities are so busy, many time patients end up waiting for a very long time. The app is to track patients, to reduce length of stay, pull reports, and create a better flow throughout a facility. The app can also be used to track almost anything to facilitate a better flow. 

There are several sets of hospital employees that will use the Find Waldo Patient Management System (FWPMS). They include admission
staff (receptionists), nurses, doctors, providers, billing and financial personnel, move staff, dispatch staff, and other
more general staff members. This collection of personnel may differ in age (18 and up), education, and technical ability.

The Find Waldo Patient Management System is designed to be intuitive to assure that hospital facility personnel of all ages,
education, and technical ability can successfully use it for patient management. However, it is expected that these
staff members be properly trained on the system prior to use.
